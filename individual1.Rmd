```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

```{r}
hist(choco$Rating)
```

## The ratings show normal like distribution with a left skew. There are outliers as can be seen in the extreme right of the histogram and at 1. 

```{r}
order <- (choco[order(choco$Rating, decreasing = TRUE), ])
head(order)
```
## As can be seen from the data, cocoa pct varies for the ratings of the choco bars. For a 70% cocoa pct, the ratings are both 4 and 5. Hence, it is evident that the ratings do not depend on cocoa pct.
