```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```
```{r}
hist(choco$Rating)
```

## The majority of the ratings is between 2.5 and 3.5 with outliers at 1 and what seems to be no ratings higher than 4.

```{r}
plot(choco$Rating,choco$Cocoa.Pct)
```

## A cocoa percentage from 65% to 70% seems to have the most high ratings density. A chocolate bar with 70% seems to be the only chocolate bar to get a 5 rating.
